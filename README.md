# Weatherapp

You can try the app  here:
http://ec2-35-183-78-117.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/

### Tasks

* The application now only reports the current weather. It should probably report the forecast e.g. a few hours from now. (tip: [openweathermap api](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5))

* The developers are still keen to run the app and its pipeline on their own computers. Share the development files for the container by using volumes, and make sure the containers are started with a command enabling hot reload.

* There are [eslint](http://eslint.org/) errors. Sloppy coding it seems. Please help.

* The app currently reports the weather only for location defined in the *backend*. Shouldn't it check the browser location and use that as the reference for making a forecast? (tip: [geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation))

* There are no tests. Where are the tests? (tip: [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) or [robot framework](http://robotframework.org/)) Disclaimer: this is not an easy task. If you really want to try writing robot tests, start by creating a third container that gives expected weather data, and direct the backend queries there by redefining the **MAP_ENDPOINT**.

* Set up the weather service in a free cloud hosting service, e.g. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free/).

* Write [ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro.html) playbooks for installing [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the app itself.
